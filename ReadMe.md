This portfolio contains projects produced during my time at university.

Gravity Lost is a space based shooter with some bullet hell elements created for an assignment over the period of a week.
The goal was a game with some interesting coded elements, for this I included enemies based that created themselves based on an edited fractal 
creation system as well as bullets working on a bezier quadratic curve using unties Lerp functions.  Unzipping the build folder and playing the exe
PPW2 prototype will allow actually playing what was produced.

Battleships was an assignment we were also given a week to produce based on a c++ game that was none object orientated and basically coded, 
it was to play identically to the original but now recoded using containers instead of arrays, pointers etc.

Both of these are currently unmarked.

Finally the last game in the folders marked year one is a piece created in first year, not as smooth as my current skills would be able 
to produce in the smae time I had to work on it but it did score 78/100.
